# What is RFOS (Reality‑First Output Standard)?
It’s a simple rule for AI answers: *show how systems work in the real world*, not just on paper. Always show failure modes, assumptions, and tradeoffs. Present **two lenses**: what institutions say vs what actually happens under stress.

**Why:** Consensus‑only answers hide breakdown points. RFOS makes those explicit.  
**What you’ll see:** BLUF, Two Lenses, Assumptions, Failure Modes, Tradeoffs, Confidence/Contestation, Sources Mix.  
**Who:** Anyone who wants practical, non‑ideological answers.
