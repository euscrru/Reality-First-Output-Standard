# Make AI Useful Again: The Reality‑First Output Standard
**TL;DR:** Answers should start with how systems perform under stress. RFOS is a tiny checklist: BLUF, Two Lenses, Assumptions, Failure Modes, Tradeoffs, Confidence/Contestation, Sources Mix.

Problem: Consensus‑only answers look neutral but hide breakdown points.  
Fix: Reality‑First by default; Consensus‑First as an option.  
How: See STANDARD.md for the minimal template.  
Call to action: Fork the repo, try RFOS in your org, and publish your viewpoint audits.
